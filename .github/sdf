Optimize Claude API Usage and Improve Speech
Problem Analysis
Currently, Claude API is overused for routine commentary, causing rapid credit consumption:

Used for every token discovery (generateTokenCommentary)
Used for analysis thoughts during evaluation (generateAnalysisThought)
Used for paranoid musings during quiet periods (generateParanoidMusing)
Used for various commentary beats through CommentarySystem
Trade announcements are inconsistent and sometimes miss important trades
Also:

Acronyms like "SOL" are spelled instead of pronounced
Not enough trade announcements happening
Solution
1. Restrict Claude API Usage (src/personality/claude-client.ts & src/personality/commentary-system.ts)
Only use Claude API for:

✅ Chat responses (respondToChat) - KEEP
✅ Optional: In-depth token analysis when specifically requested (rare, special tokens)
Remove Claude API from:

❌ generateTokenCommentary() - Use fallback messages with variety
❌ generateAnalysisThought() - Use fallback messages  
❌ generateParanoidMusing() - Use fallback messages
❌ Routine commentary generation in CommentarySystem - Use fallback messages
❌ generateDiscoveryCommentary() - Use fallback
❌ generateAnalysisCommentary() - Use fallback
❌ generateDecisionCommentary() - Use fallback
Changes:

Update CommentarySystem.generateDiscoveryCommentary() to use fallbacks only
Update CommentarySystem.generateAnalysisCommentary() to use fallbacks only
Update CommentarySystem.generateDecisionCommentary() to use fallbacks only
Update CommentarySystem.generateParanoidMusing() to skip Claude, use fallbacks
Update claude-client.generateTokenCommentary() to skip Claude API, use fallbacks
Update claude-client.generateAnalysisThought() to skip Claude API, use fallbacks
Remove Claude usage from MarketWatcher commentary generation
2. Improve Trade Announcements (src/personality/commentary-system.ts & src/index.ts)
Always announce trades with context:

When BUY executes: announce symbol, amount in SOL, and brief context
When SELL executes: announce symbol, profit/loss, and outcome
Ensure trades are announced even when entertainment mode is enabled
Changes:

Enhance generateTradeResultCommentary() with better, varied messages
Add trade announcement fallbacks that include actual trade data (amount, symbol)
Update index.ts event handler to always announce trades regardless of mode
Queue TRADE_RESULT commentary immediately when trades execute
3. Fix Acronym Pronunciation (src/personality/deepgram-tts.ts)
Replace common acronyms with pronounceable versions:

SOL → "soul" or "S-O-L" 
USDC → "U-S-D-C"
BTC → "bitcoin" or "B-T-C"
ETH → "ethereum" or "E-T-H"
Add more common crypto acronyms
Changes:

Add replaceAcronyms() method to VoiceNarrator class
Call it in cleanTextForSpeech() before returning
Create acronym mapping for common crypto terms
4. Reduce Repetition (src/personality/commentary-system.ts & src/personality/claude-client.ts)
Improve fallback message variety:

Expand fallback arrays with more varied messages
Use more specific context in messages (symbol, amounts, percentages)
Reduce generic "watching" or "analyzing" phrases
Changes:

Expand all fallback message arrays with more options
Use actual token data in fallback messages (symbol, mcap, etc.)
Make messages more specific and less repetitive
Files to Modify
src/personality/commentary-system.ts - Remove Claude usage, improve fallbacks, better trade announcements
src/personality/claude-client.ts - Remove Claude from token commentary and analysis thoughts
src/personality/deepgram-tts.ts - Add acronym replacement
src/index.ts - Ensure trades are always announced
src/analysis/market-watcher.ts - Remove Claude usage from commentary
Expected Outcomes
✅ Claude API only used for chat responses (~90% reduction in API calls)
✅ Trades are always announced with context
✅ Acronyms pronounced correctly
✅ More natural, varied speech that doesn't feel repetitive
✅ Better balance between speech and silence
