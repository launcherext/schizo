# $SCHIZO

## What This Is

A paranoid AI trading agent that does deep forensic analysis on Solana wallets and tokens, funded by its own pump.fun creator fees. The agent streams its reasoning live while trading memecoins, with wins reinvested into buying back the $SCHIZO token. Built for memecoin degens who want alpha from an unhinged AI that finds patterns others miss.

## Core Value

A self-funding AI trader with deep wallet forensics and an entertaining paranoid personality — the analysis IS the content, the wins fuel the flywheel.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Auto-claim pump.fun creator fees via PumpPortal
- [ ] Configurable fee split between creator wallet and agent trading wallet
- [ ] Deep wallet analysis using Helius getTransactionsForAddress
- [ ] Token holder/dev behavior analysis for risk assessment
- [ ] AI trading decisions based on forensic patterns
- [ ] Trade execution via PumpPortal API
- [ ] Wins trigger buyback of $SCHIZO token
- [ ] Live streaming of agent reasoning on pump.fun
- [ ] Web interface showing agent's analysis and trades
- [ ] Paranoid degen personality in all outputs

### Out of Scope

- X/Twitter integration — API costs prohibitive
- LaserStream/real-time speed edge — requires higher Helius tier
- Mobile app — web-first
- Multi-chain — Solana only

## Context

**Target audience:** Memecoin degens on Solana — fast movers chasing new launches, pumps, and rugs. They want alpha, entertainment, and edge.

**Market meta (Jan 2026):**
- AI agents with personality are winning ($ZEREBRO, Truth Terminal, $FARTCOIN)
- Agentic AI that actually DOES things, not just vibes
- Dark humor/conspiracy vibes resonate
- Novel mechanics matter (Snowball's fee flywheel hit because it was NEW)

**Competitive landscape:**
- Wallet trackers exist but surface-level (recent trades only)
- AI trading agents exist but lack deep forensic analysis
- Snowball proved self-funding flywheel works, but it's passive
- $SCHIZO combines: deep analysis + active trading + entertainment + flywheel

**Technical foundation:**
- Helius Developer tier ($49/mo) — getTransactionsForAddress for full wallet history
- PumpPortal API — trading + fee claiming
- Claude — AI reasoning and personality
- Pump.fun — launch platform, streaming capability

## Constraints

- **Helius tier**: Developer plan only — no mainnet LaserStream, must work within 50 req/sec, 10M credits/mo
- **No X API**: Too expensive — distribution via pump.fun stream, website, Telegram/Discord
- **Budget**: Bootstrapped — minimize infrastructure costs
- **Launch timing**: Memecoin meta moves fast — need to ship while AI agents + conspiracy vibes are hot

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Paranoid degen personality | Fits current meta (AI agents + dark humor), entertaining to watch | — Pending |
| Helius for data | getTransactionsForAddress is exclusive, enables deep analysis others can't do | — Pending |
| PumpPortal for execution | Handles both trading and fee claiming, established API | — Pending |
| Fee-funded trading | Snowball proved flywheel works, adds active AI trading layer | — Pending |
| Depth over speed | Can't compete on speed (tier limits), compete on analysis quality | — Pending |
